Windows - a line is represented by CRLF(Carriage Return and Line Feed). On windows you get:
`warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF` . To turn the warning off run:
`git config core.autocrlf true`

`git reset HEAD -- .`

Add application plugin and mainClass to build gradle and run the app with: `./gradlew run`
